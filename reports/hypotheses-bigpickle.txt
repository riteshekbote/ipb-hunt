[PRIO] pluto.portal.ipb.de,7.7,multi-tenancy/admin API (auth-gated IDOR/BOLA surface)
[PRIO] event.ipb.de,4.5,pretix ticketing/control
[PRIO] www.ipb.de,3.0,Plesk PHP static
[NEW] pluto.portal.ipb.de live — React SPA backed by DRF multi-tenancy API (200)
[NEW] event.ipb.de live — pretix ticketing (200), nginx/1.31.4
[NEW] www.ipb.de live — PHP/8.3.33 on PleskLin (200)
[NEW] ipb.de → 301 → www.ipb.de
[CHANGED] `.env`/`server-info` on www.ipb.de → 403 (blocked, not exposed)
[HYP] Multi-tenancy IDOR/BOLA across user/membership/tenant endpoints
[HYP] Kiosk token check-in auth bypass / user enumeration
[HYP] Unauthenticated CSRF token issuance via /api/ct/
[PARKED] Kiosk token bypass: token unknown, cannot test without token → confidence <40
[PARKED] CSRF token leak: rotates per request, no session binding → low impact
[FINAL] Multi-tenancy IDOR (needs auth) / check-in enumeration
[NEXT] HUMANAUTH — need a valid account on pluto.portal.ipb.de to test the multi-tenant IDOR/BOLA surface (user/me, membership, tenant-relationship, user-token)
[LEARN] ACCEPTED framework recon @ pluto.portal.ipb.de — DRF with multi-tenancy; auth required, CSRF via /api/ct/
[LEARN] REJECTED open-redirect @ event.ipb.de — /redirect/ validates against fixed allowlist
[RISK] ipb: 55 — pluto portal exposes a very large authenticated API; any account grants deep multi-tenant access; gated by auth so unauthenticated risk moderate
[NEW] pluto.portal.ipb.de live — Django REST Framework multi-tenant customer portal (React SPA)
[NEW] event.ipb.de live — pretix ticketing (nginx/1.31.4)
[NEW] www.ipb.de live — PHP/8.3.33 on PleskLin
[NEW] ipb.de → 301 → www.ipb.de
[CHANGED] `/.env`, `/server-info` on www.ipb.de → 403 (blocked, not exposed)
[PRIO] pluto.portal.ipb.de,7.15,BOLA-IDOR (DRF multi-tenancy + admin exports; auth-gated but high business value)
[PRIO] event.ipb.de,4.95,pretix-broken-auth (mature hardening: /control 403, /redirect allowlisted)
[PRIO] www.ipb.de,3.00,Plesk-static
[HYP] Cross-tenant BOLA across membership/tenant/user endpoints
class: IDOR
asset: pluto.portal.ipb.de /api/multi-tenancy/v1/... and /api/admin/multi-tenancy/v1/...
confidence: 60
reasoning: DRF multi-tenancy exposes per-tenant user/membership/relationship objects with EAV + bulk export endpoints; object IDs are sequential; per-tenant authorization is the prime BOLA chokepoint. All endpoints return `Authentication credentials were not provided` unauthenticated.
evidence_needed: authenticated low-priv account reading another tenant's user/membership/relationship objects by ID
verify_steps: POST /api/session/ {username,password} to obtain session; GET /api/multi-tenancy/v1/tenant/{id}/ and /api/multi-tenancy/v1/user/{id}/ across tenant boundaries as low-priv user
impact: cross-tenant PII dump / privilege escalation — HIGH
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Admin dynamic-config mass assignment override
class: MISCONFIG
asset: pluto.portal.ipb.de /api/admin/dynamic-config/v1/config-namespace/apply/
confidence: 45
reasoning: SPA calls adminCreateDynamicConfig with arbitrary keys → apply/; no scoping in bundle; config namespaces (branding/motd/dns) could be overridden.
evidence_needed: authenticated admin (or elevated) writing to another namespace
impact: config tampering / defacement
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Check-in kiosk token user-enumeration
class: AUTH
asset: pluto.portal.ipb.de /api/check-in/v1/check-in/kiosk_login/
confidence: 45
reasoning: POST {token} returns `No User matches the given query.` vs other responses for invalid — token existence oracle; no rate limit observed.
evidence_needed: enumerate valid 32-hex kiosk tokens without auth
impact: low alone, weakens kiosk gate
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[PARKED] CSRF token leak via /api/ct/: token rotates per request, not bound to any session — no replay/CSRF value. <40.
[PARKED] open-redirect on event.ipb.de /redirect/: allowlisted (400 on arbitrary URLs); rejected class anyway.
[PARKED] www.ipb.de .env/server-info: 403, not exposed.
[FINAL] Cross-tenant BOLA (60) > dynamic-config mass-assignment (45) > kiosk enumeration (45)
[NEXT] HUMANAUTH: sponsor a low-privilege credentialed account on pluto.portal.ipb.de to exercise cross-tenant BOLA on /api/multi-tenancy/v1/tenant/{id}/ and /api/multi-tenancy/v1/user/{id}/
[LEARN] ACCEPTED framework-recon AUTH @ pluto.portal.ipb.de: DRF multi-tenancy, all data endpoints auth-gated, CSRF via unbound /api/ct/.
[LEARN] REJECTED open-redirect @ event.ipb.de: /redirect/ enforces fixed allowlist; reject open-redirect class here.
[LEARN] REJECTED config-exposure @ www.ipb.de: .env/server-info 403 (blocked).
[RISK] ipb: 55 — pluto.portal.ipb.de exposes an unusually large authenticated multi-tenant API (PII, DNS, inventory, shipping, check-in, AI); surface is high but gated by auth. Unauthenticated risk moderate. Highest exposure emerges once any credentialed account is obtained.
